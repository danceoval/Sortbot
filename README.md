Sortbot
=======

This was for a Behavior-Based Artificial Intelligene project for Vassar College's COGS211 "Perception and Action" class. Sortbot is designed to navigate an environment of overturned red and blue solo cups. Sortbot searches through the cups and carries the red cups to one side of the arena and the blue cups to the parallel side.
